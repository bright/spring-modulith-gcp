# Bright Spring Modulith GCP

This project aims to integrate [Spring Modulith](https://spring.io/projects/spring-modulith) with Google Cloud Platform
services. The initial focus is on supporting GCP Datastore through a custom, work-in-progress transaction manager that
overcomes the limitations of the official GCP Spring library.

## Project Goals

- **Spring Modulith & GCP Datastore (WIP):**  
  Implement a dedicated transaction manager to seamlessly integrate Spring Modulith with GCP Datastore, removing the
  limitations of the existing manager provided by the official library.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  Support for GCP Firebase and Spanner is planned for future development.

## Guidelines

Please refer to the [guidelines](.junie/guidelines.md) for further information on code style and testing practices. Note
that the project adheres to Spring Boot Starter conventions and Gradle's Kotlin DSL using version 8.13, as well as JVM
target 21.
